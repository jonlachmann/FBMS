\title{Merge a list of multiple results from many runs
This function will weight the features based on the best mlik in that population
and merge the results together, simplifying by merging equivalent features (having high correlation).}
\usage{
merge_results(
  results,
  populations = NULL,
  complex.measure = NULL,
  tol = NULL,
  data = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A list containing multiple results from GMJMCMC (Genetically Modified MJMCMC).}

\item{populations}{Which populations should be merged from the results, can be "all", "last" (default) or "best".}

\item{complex.measure}{The complex measure to use when finding the simplest equivalent feature,
1=total width, 2=operation count and 3=depth.}

\item{tol}{The tolerance to use for the correlation when finding equivalent features, default is 0.}

\item{data}{Data to use when comparing features, default is NULL meaning that mock data will be generated,
if data is supplied it should be of the same form as is required by gmjmcmc, i.e. with both x, y and an intercept.}
