\usage{
gaussian.loglik2(y, x, model, complex, mlpost_params)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A vector containing the dependent variable}

\item{x}{The matrix containing the precalculated features}

\item{mlpost_params}{A list of parameters for the log likelihood, supplied by the user}
}
\value{
A list with the log marginal likelihood combined with the log prior (crit) and the posterior mode of the coefficients (coefs).
