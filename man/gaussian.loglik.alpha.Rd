\title{Log likelihood function for gaussian regression for alpha calculation
This function is just the bare likelihood function
Note that it only gives a proportional value and is equivalent to least squares}
\usage{
gaussian.loglik.alpha(a, data, mu_func)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{A vector of the alphas to be used}

\item{data}{The data to be used for calculation}

\item{mu_func}{The function linking the mean to the covariates,
as a string with the alphas as a[i].}
}
\value{
A numeric with the log likelihood.
}
